            <p>to Arthur Morgan:
            </p>
            <p>King Arthur.</p>
        
            <p>
                What a scarred, beautiful soul.<br>
            <br>
            What a giant amongst men.<br>
            <br>
            I finally finished Red Dead Redemption 2 recently, and it’s safe to say that as far as I’m concerned not only does Arthur Morgan easily take his place beside John Marston in the pantheon of All-Time Greatest Video Game Characters, but I can count on the fingers of one hand the characters that have elicited a stronger emotional connection from me than the gruff and grizzled doomed poet that is Mr. Arthur Morgan. By the end of Red Dead Redemption 2, after I had lived and seen Arthur Morgan’s story, I felt as John Marston himself must have: overflowing with love and respect for this tragic, wonderful man who in the end gave him everything.<br>
            <br>
            I know, I know. Sounds like awful hyperbole. Arthur himself would likely smile and raise an eyebrow and make a sly remark about it if he heard.<br>

            Yet it’s all true.

            <h2>The Art of Crafting Realistic Characters: A Tribute to Arthur Morgan</h2>

            <p>Characters that Feel Real
            It’s rare indeed for a fictional character to come flying off the page or screen in such a way as to feel as if they have always existed. As if the story we had witnessed them in wasn’t conjured by a writer but had simply been a glimpse into some real person’s life. One of the prime examples of this effect for me is always Richard Linklater’s wonderful Before films. I absolutely adore those movies. They mean the world to me. From the moment I first saw them on screen, Celene and Jesse have never felt like anything less than fully realized people. Now, decades later, they feel like old friends. Aside from the towering masterpiece, The Last Of Us Part 2, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the closest I’ve come to feeling that from a video game.

            That’s quite a turnaround for a game the protagonist of which I didn’t care for at first. I think part of the reason Arthur Morgan made such a huge impact on me in the end is precisely because of that initial apathy I had toward him. When we first meet Arthur there doesn’t seem all that much to him. He comes across as essentially just a soldier, loyally following the orders of his captain, gang leader Dutch van der Linde, without much else to intrigue us. There are glimmers of individuality, humor, and empathy, but by and large what we’re presented with when we meet Arthur Morgan is a hulking outlaw; rough, hard, and willing to do what needs to be done for his boss.</p>
